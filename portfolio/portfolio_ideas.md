# 42 Minishell Project Portfolio

## Project Overview
A custom implementation of a shell program inspired by bash, demonstrating advanced systems programming and Unix concepts.

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Command Line Interpreter
- Custom-built parser for command line inputs
- Support for multiple commands with pipes and redirections
- Built-in command implementation (cd, echo, pwd, export, unset, env, exit)
- Environment variable expansion

### 2. Process Management
- Fork and execution handling
- Signal handling (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+\)
- Background process management
- Multi-pipe command execution

### 3. Memory Management
- Clean memory allocation and deallocation
- No memory leaks
- Efficient resource handling

### 4. Advanced Features
- Heredoc implementation
- Environment variable management
- Quote handling (single and double quotes)
- Error handling and custom error messages
